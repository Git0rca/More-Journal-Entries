Journal Entries:
	Journal Entries should be prefixed with "je_"

Events:
	Events should have a name and a number: example.1
	Title, Description and Flavortext should then be named like this:
		title = event.1.t
		desc = event.1.d
		flavor = event.1.f
	Different Options should then be named like this:
		event.1.a
		event.1.b
		event.1.c
	If you need more than 3 options this creates the problem of overlapping with the Description. In that case use:
		event.1.de
		event.1.ef
		event.1.te #an event should probably to go up to the letter t
	You may also exchange the letters for something the option is or does, if possible: e. g. event.1.pru for an option that can only be picked by Prussia

Modifiers:
	Modifiers have to end in "_modifier" else the localization won't work
