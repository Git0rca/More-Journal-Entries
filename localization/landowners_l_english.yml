  je_landowners_government_goal: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] has been part of a government with 50 or more legitimacy for at least 12 consecutive months."
  je_landowners_fate: "The Fate of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName]"
  je_landowners_fate_reason: "If you choose to modernize the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] the progress bar will slowly fill.
